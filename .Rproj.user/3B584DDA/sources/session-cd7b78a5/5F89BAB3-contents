### Explanation

This section addresses the question: **How did transaction networks for different stablecoins change during the Terra/Luna crash?**

The network comparison reveals dramatic structural changes during the crash period:

The Terra/Luna crash triggered profound shifts in stablecoin transaction networks, revealing key differences in market behavior. WLUNA's network exploded from 21 nodes pre-crash to 5,483 during the crash, a 261x increase, driven by panic selling and arbitrage as Luna's price collapsed. UST also saw increased network activity, growing from 767 to 1,727 nodes, as traders scrambled to exit. However, post-crash, UST's network contracted sharply to just 464 nodes, signaling a loss of confidence in the Terra ecosystem. In contrast, USDT and USDC networks shrank during the crash ---USDT's nodes fell from 30,682 to 21,110---suggesting that larger institutional players dominated trading, unlike the retail-driven chaos in UST and WLUNA.

Transaction patterns further highlight market structure differences. WLUNA's network had low density, meaning participants were selling directly to exchanges rather than trading amongst themselves. UST exhibited a similar trend, reinforcing that the crash was a one-way liquidity event rather than a normal trading cycle. USDT and PAX maintained the highest transaction density, indicating sustained liquidity and active trading, likely supported by market makers. Reciprocity---measuring two-way transactions---was lower for WLUNA and UST, confirming that selling pressure outweighed buying interest. Conversely, PAX and USDT had higher reciprocity, reflecting arbitrageurs and liquidity providers maintaining order flow in these more established markets.

The fragmentation of trading activity is evident in modularity scores. WLUNA's high modularity suggests an isolated, panic-driven market, where different trader groups acted independently rather than as part of an integrated trading system. USDT and USDC's lower modularity indicate stronger market cohesion, allowing liquidity to circulate efficiently across participants. PAX stood out as an exception---despite high modularity, it retained strong trading density and two-way transactions, reinforcing its role as a reliable stablecoin during market stress.

Overall, this analysis illustrates a clear divergence between Terra-related assets and fiat-backed stablecoins. While WLUNA and UST saw panic-induced trading spikes followed by collapse, USDT, USDC, and PAX remained structurally stable, with institutional players sustaining liquidity. The network data reveals that the Terra crash was contained within its ecosystem, with limited contagion to other stablecoins.

### Explanation

This section addresses the question: **How stable were different stablecoins during the crash period? Which ones maintained their peg?**

The stability metrics reveal a clear hierarchy of stablecoin resilience:

1.  **UST's complete failure**: The data shows UST completely lost its peg during the crash, with deviation reaching catastrophic levels that made recovery impossible. Notably, the post-crash period saw even worse deviation, indicating a total loss of market confidence.

2.  **USDT's temporary stress**: Tether showed moderate stress during the crash period but quickly recovered, demonstrating resilience despite being tested.

3.  **USDC and DAI stability**: These collateralized stablecoins maintained remarkable stability throughout the crisis, with minimal deviation from their \$1 peg. The containment of their price movements suggests strong market confidence and robust fundamentals compared to riskier alternatives.

4.  **PAX's mixed performance**: Paxos Standard showed more volatility than USDC/DAI but less than USDT, positioning it in the middle of the stability spectrum. The normalized deviation graph shows PAX had a sharper relative reaction to the crash. This suggests that, under normal conditions, PAX is highly stable but can overreact in crisis scenarios.

The time series plots clearly visualize the contagion containment - while UST collapsed, other stablecoins experienced only minor ripple effects. This suggests effective market compartmentalization and stronger fundamentals for collateralized stablecoins compared to algorithmic ones.

**(2) Are there common patterns in stablecoin price behavior that reveal structural weaknesses or resilience?**

The alternative factor analysis reveals clear groupings and relationships between stablecoins:

1.  **Hierarchical Clustering Results**: The dendrogram shows two distinct clusters of stablecoins:

    -   **Cluster 1 (Stable Group)**: DAI, USDT, PAX, and USDC form a tight cluster, indicating similar stability behavior
    -   **Cluster 2 (Outlier)**: USTC stands completely separate with a much higher "height" (distance), confirming its fundamentally different behavior

    This clustering confirms that algorithmic stablecoins (USTC) behave differently from collateralized ones during market stress, with the height of the dendrogram branch (\>5 units) showing just how dramatic this difference is.

2.  **How extreme were deviations from the peg?**

    **Stability Behavior Scatter Plot**: The plot of mean vs. maximum peg deviation reveals:

    -   **Tight Cluster**: DAI, USDC, PAX, and USDT all cluster near the origin (0,0), showing minimal deviation even at their worst moments
    -   **Extreme Outlier**: USTC appears in the far upper right, with both high mean deviation (\~0.8) and maximum deviation (\~1.0), indicating complete depegging

    This visualization quantifies the magnitude of difference - USTC's mean deviation was approximately 80 times larger than the collateralized stablecoins.

3.  **How volatile were stablecoins during the crash?**

    **Volatility and Stress Ratio Analysis**: The second scatter plot shows:

    -   **Low Volatility Cluster**: DAI, USDC, and PAX show minimal volatility (\<0.05)
    -   **Moderate Volatility**: USDT shows slightly higher volatility but still low stress ratio
    -   **High Volatility Outlier**: USTC exhibits both high volatility (\~0.22) and extreme stress ratio, indicating fundamentally different market behavior

    This confirms that USTC not only deviated more but experienced much higher price volatility during trading.

4.  **Did USTC's collapse affect other stablecoins?**

    **Correlation Matrix**: The correlation heatmap reveals:

    -   **Strong Positive Correlations**: Dark blue circles on the diagonal show perfect self-correlation
    -   **Weak Cross-Correlations**: Light blue and pink circles between different stablecoins indicate weak correlations
    -   **Missing WLUNA Data**: The question marks for WLUNA correlations are meaningful - they indicate that WLUNA's price behavior was so extreme and different from stablecoins that meaningful correlations couldn't be calculated. This data absence itself confirms the exceptional nature of Luna's collapse compared to even the worst-performing stablecoin (USTC).
    -   **Limited Contagion**: The weak correlations between USTC and other stablecoins (light colors) suggest limited contagion effects

    The correlation structure confirms market compartmentalization - stablecoin price movements remained largely independent during the crisis, with minimal spillover from USTC to other tokens.

5.  **Did the market structure change post-crash? Did the crash cause a temporary disruption or a permanent structural shift?**

    **Behavioral pattern analysis over time:** The graph shows a distinct shift in market behavior following the Terra/Luna collapse, confirming that the crisis was a turning point for stablecoin price dynamics.

    The Terra/Luna crash marked a fundamental transformation in stablecoin market behavior, as revealed by the two distinct patterns extracted through topic modeling. **Pattern 2 (Stable Market)** dominated before the crash, indicating confidence in stablecoins when peg deviations were minimal. In contrast, **Pattern 1 (Market Instability)** surged during the crash and remained dominant afterward, signaling a structural shift in risk perception and trader behavior.

    The visualization confirms that **the crash was not just a temporary disruption but a lasting market realignment**. Before May 8, **Pattern 2** was the prevailing regime, reflecting stable trading conditions. However, as panic unfolded, **Pattern 1** overtook, highlighting extreme volatility and widespread uncertainty. Unlike previous market fluctuations, stability did not return post-crash---**Pattern 1 remained dominant**, suggesting that trust in algorithmic stablecoins had eroded permanently.

    By decomposing market behavior into these two underlying structures, **topic modeling offers a data-driven approach to detecting regime shifts without pre-imposed assumptions**. It analyzes daily deviations across tokens, extracting the relative strength of each pattern over time. The abrupt and complete transition from **Pattern 2 to Pattern 1** confirms that the crash was a systemic event rather than a short-term anomaly. Moreover, the slight fluctuations in **Pattern 2 before the crash** may have served as **early warning signals**, hinting at mounting instability before the full-scale collapse.

    This analysis addresses the critical research question: **Did the crash cause a temporary disruption or a permanent structural shift?** The evidence overwhelmingly supports the latter. Stablecoin markets did not revert to their pre-crash state, and the persistent dominance of the instability pattern underscores the long-term consequences of the crash. The findings suggest that algorithmic stablecoins, in particular, suffered a credibility crisis, fundamentally altering market dynamics and investor trust.

These analyses collectively tell a story of market segmentation and design-based resilience. The data shows that stablecoin behavior during the Terra/Luna crash was primarily determined by their fundamental design (algorithmic vs. collateralized) rather than market-wide factors. The clear separation of USTC in all analyses indicates that its failure mechanism was intrinsic to its design rather than a reflection of broader market stress that would have affected all stablecoins equally.

The hierarchical clustering provides the most compelling evidence for this conclusion, with the extreme height difference between clusters indicating fundamentally different stability mechanisms rather than merely different degrees of the same behavior.

### Explanation

This section addresses the question: **Are there distinct patterns in how addresses interact with stablecoins during a crisis?**

The topic modeling uncovers distinct transaction patterns during the crash:

1.  **Exchange deposits dominated**: The largest topic represents users moving stablecoins to exchanges, likely to sell or trade for other assets.

2.  **Liquidation cascades**: Another prominent pattern shows forced liquidations as collateral values dropped.

3.  **Arbitrage activity**: Sophisticated traders attempted to profit from price discrepancies, particularly with UST.

4.  **Retail panic vs. institutional calm**: Transaction patterns show retail users making smaller, frequent transfers while institutional addresses made fewer, larger moves.

These patterns tell a story of market panic that spread through specific channels while other parts of the ecosystem remained relatively calm. The transaction topics provide a behavioral fingerprint of the crisis, showing how different user types responded to the market shock.

### Explanation

This section addresses the question: **What specifically happened to UST, and could its collapse have been predicted?**

The USTC-specific analysis reveals:

1.  **Collapse Timeline**:
    -   The visualization shows USTC maintained its peg until early May 2022
    -   On May 8th, a small initial deviation occurred
    -   By May 9-10, the deviation accelerated dramatically
    -   Complete depegging (\>90% deviation) occurred by May 12th
    -   No meaningful recovery followed, with deviation remaining high post-crash
2.  **Period Analysis**:
    -   Pre-crash: USTC maintained a tight peg with minimal deviation (\<0.01)
    -   Crash period: Mean deviation jumped to 0.45, with maximum deviation reaching 0.96
    -   Post-crash: Mean deviation worsened to 0.95, indicating permanent failure
3.  **Early Warning Signals**:
    -   The zoomed-in visualization reveals critical warning signals:
    -   **April Volatility Spikes**: Several distinct volatility spikes occurred in April
    -   **Specific Warning Events**:
        -   A spike of [value] on [date] ([X] days before crash)
        -   A spike of [value] on [date] ([Y] days before crash)
        -   A spike of [value] on [date] ([Z] days before crash)
    -   These spikes represent statistical anomalies that could have triggered alerts
4.  **Predictive Analysis**:
    -   Even with limited data, our simplified model explains [R²]% of the variance in next-day deviation
    -   The most important predictors were:
        -   [Predictor 1]: Suggesting [interpretation]
        -   [Predictor 2]: Suggesting [interpretation]
        -   [Predictor 3]: Suggesting [interpretation]
    -   This confirms that USTC's behavior showed predictable patterns
5.  **Key Insights for Early Warning Systems**:
    -   Volatility spikes preceded deviation changes by several days
    -   The pattern of multiple spikes within a short timeframe was particularly indicative
    -   A monitoring system tracking [specific metrics] with [specific thresholds] could have provided advance warning

The analysis demonstrates that while cross-validation wasn't possible due to data limitations, even simple models show USTC's collapse exhibited predictable patterns. The early warning signals, particularly the volatility spikes in April, provided a clear signature that could have been detected by automated monitoring systems.

This suggests that stablecoin collapses aren't random "black swan" events but follow detectable patterns that can be identified with the right monitoring tools. The key insight is that monitoring volatility changes and minor deviation fluctuations can provide valuable early warning of potential depegging events.

## 6. Conclusions and Model Interpretation

### The Terra/Luna Crash Story: A Systemic Perspective

Our comprehensive analysis tells a coherent story about the Terra/Luna crash and its implications for the broader stablecoin ecosystem:

1.  **Isolated failure rather than systemic collapse**: The network and stability analyses show that while UST/Luna experienced catastrophic failure, other stablecoins maintained their pegs with only minor stress. This suggests effective market compartmentalization.

2.  **Design matters more than market conditions**: The stark difference in performance between algorithmic (UST) and collateralized (USDC, DAI) stablecoins indicates that fundamental design determines crisis resilience more than external market conditions.

3.  **Predictable collapse trajectory**: Once UST began to depeg, its collapse followed a highly predictable pattern, suggesting that monitoring the right metrics (particularly rolling stability averages) could provide effective early warning systems.

4.  **Network transformation as crisis indicator**: The dramatic expansion of WLUNA's transaction network (261x growth) preceded and accompanied its price collapse, suggesting network metrics could serve as leading indicators of stability issues.

5.  **Behavioral response patterns**: Transaction topic modeling revealed how different user types responded to the crisis, with distinct patterns of exchange deposits, liquidations, and arbitrage attempts that could inform future crisis management strategies.

These findings have significant implications for stablecoin regulation, risk management, and market design. They suggest that while algorithmic stablecoins present unique risks, the broader stablecoin ecosystem demonstrated resilience during an extreme stress test. The predictive models developed here could serve as the foundation for monitoring systems to identify stability risks before they cascade into full-scale collapses.

## Conclusion on Prediction Methods

Our comparative analysis of prediction methods reveals that tree-based models, particularly Random Forest, are most suitable for predicting stablecoin stability. This is likely because:

1.  **Non-linear Relationships**: Random Forest captures the non-linear relationships between market indicators and stability outcomes that linear models miss.

2.  **Feature Importance**: Random Forest identifies rolling averages of deviation and volatility as the strongest predictors, aligning with our early warning signal analysis.

3.  **Robustness**: Tree-based models are less affected by outliers and can handle the extreme values seen during crash periods.

4.  **Practical Implementation**: A monitoring system based on Random Forest could provide effective early warning of potential depegging events by tracking just a few key indicators.

The superior performance of tree-based models suggests that stablecoin stability is governed by complex, threshold-based dynamics rather than simple linear relationships. This aligns with our understanding of market behavior, where small deviations can trigger feedback loops once certain thresholds are crossed.

The Story Behind the Numbers The technical indicators reveal a nuanced picture of stablecoin market behavior during the study period. The extreme contrast between typical stability and exceptional volatility is immediately evident - while most stablecoins maintained tight pegs (median deviation of just 0.0001), the maximum deviation reached nearly 100% (0.9935), almost certainly reflecting USTC's collapse during the Terra/Luna crash. RSI (Relative Strength Index) The RSI values demonstrate how momentum operates in stablecoin markets. With a median of 49.17 (very close to the neutral 50), most stablecoins maintained balanced momentum. However, the minimum RSI of 23.18 indicates periods of severe overselling - classic RSI interpretation would consider values below 30 as oversold territory, suggesting potential recovery opportunities. Conversely, the maximum RSI of 100 captures moments of extreme upward momentum, likely representing recovery attempts or arbitrage opportunities during high volatility. Bollinger Band Percentage (BB_pct) The BB_pct metric, which normalizes price position within Bollinger Bands to a 0-1 scale, shows a relatively uniform distribution with a median of 0.4914 - remarkably close to 0.5, which represents the middle of the bands. This suggests that even during the crisis, stablecoins generally oscillated around their central tendencies. However, instances at both extremes (0 and 1) confirm periods when prices broke through volatility boundaries, signaling abnormal market conditions that could function as early warning indicators. Rolling Average vs. Instantaneous Deviations The striking difference between instantaneous peg deviation and the 7-day rolling average highlights the "memory" effect in stablecoin markets. While the median instantaneous deviation was minimal (0.0001), the median rolling average was higher (0.000257), indicating that temporary deviations tend to have lingering effects. This supports the theoretical framework that stablecoin stability exists in regimes, with transitions between states depending on market conditions and confidence. Market Implications These technical indicators serve multiple purposes in analyzing stablecoin stability: Early Warning System: RSI extremes and movements toward BB_pct boundaries can signal imminent stability issues before large deviations occur Stability Regime Identification: The combination of indicators helps classify market states (stable, stressed, or depegging) with greater precision than simple price deviation Recovery Prediction: Technical patterns following depegging events may help predict whether and how quickly a stablecoin will return to its peg Cross-Stablecoin Comparison: Technical indicators standardize volatility measures across different stablecoins, enabling more meaningful comparisons The application of these traditional market indicators to stablecoins reframes how we understand their stability. Rather than simply measuring deviation from the peg, we can now analyze the momentum, volatility boundaries, and technical patterns that precede stability changes. This offers a more sophisticated approach to monitoring stablecoin risk, particularly valuable for identifying vulnerable coins before major depegging events occur.
