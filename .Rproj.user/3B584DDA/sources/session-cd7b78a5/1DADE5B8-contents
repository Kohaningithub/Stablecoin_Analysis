## Purpose and Methodology

This analysis aims to identify the key predictors of stablecoin stability using LASSO and Ridge regression. The approach combines methods from several previous analyses:

1. **Feature Selection (HW1 approach)**:
   - Use FDR-controlled marginal screening to identify significant predictors
   - Control false discoveries while maintaining power
   - Examine p-value distributions for evidence of signal

2. **Model Selection (HW2 approach)**:
   - Compare full and reduced models
   - Use cross-validation for model validation
   - Examine significance of coefficients

3. **Prediction Performance (HW4 approach)**:
   - Implement rigorous cross-validation
   - Compare in-sample and out-of-sample performance
   - Examine model stability

## Data Preparation

```{r}
source("lasso_stability.R")

# Load results if not already in environment
if(!exists("results")) {
  results <- readRDS("task1_results.rds")
}

# Check data availability
cat("Data Summary:\n")
print(table(results$stability$daily$token))
cat("\nDate Range:\n")
print(range(results$stability$daily$date))
```

## Model Training and Evaluation

The analysis follows these steps:

1. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create lagged variables for autocorrelation
   - Generate rolling statistics
   - Create interaction terms

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Use K-fold cross-validation
   - Compare minimum-MSE vs 1SE lambda
   - Evaluate model parsimony vs performance

3. **Performance Assessment**:
   - Examine RÂ² and RMSE metrics
   - Compare LASSO vs Ridge performance
   - Analyze feature importance

```{r}
# Run stability analysis
stability_results <- run_stability_analysis(results)
```

## Results Interpretation

```{r}
# Plot model comparison if we have results
if(length(stability_results) > 0) {
  plot_model_comparison(stability_results)
}
```

The analysis reveals:

1. **Feature Importance**:
   - Which predictors are most important for stability
   - How importance varies across stablecoins
   - Differences between LASSO and Ridge selection

2. **Model Performance**:
   - How well we can predict stability
   - Which stablecoins are more predictable
   - Evidence of nonlinear relationships

3. **Stability Patterns**:
   - Common predictors across stablecoins
   - Unique predictors for specific tokens
   - Temporal stability patterns

## Conclusions

The LASSO/Ridge analysis provides insights into:
- Key drivers of stablecoin stability
- Predictability of different stablecoins
- Effectiveness of different prediction approaches

These findings can inform:
- Risk assessment of stablecoins
- Early warning systems for instability
- Regulatory considerations
